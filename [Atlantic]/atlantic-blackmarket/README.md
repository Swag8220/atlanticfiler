# esx_blackmarket
I did not make this script. This is a rework of ```esx_shops```, so all credits goes to the original creator. I added an option to turn map blips on/off in ```config.lua```, changed the currency to dirty money, added new locations (look ```config.lua```) and some small other changes.
